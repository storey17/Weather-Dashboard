# Weather-Dashboard_HW-6

PURPOSE
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

FUNCTIONALITY
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
//Added an API call to Open Weather api and filled in the required informaiton on the card. Made a seperate API call for the UV index as well as for the 5 day forecast. 

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
//See above for more detials

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
//Used a seperate API call for this feature and called the temperature and humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
